# Plant Disease Recognition using CNN

This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for recognizing plant diseases. The CNN model is trained to classify images of plant leaves into different disease categories. The project includes building the CNN model in a Google Colab notebook, importing it to a local machine, deploying it using a Streamlit web application, and further deploying it as a Docker container.
